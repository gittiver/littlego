/// @brief The ApplicationDelegate class implements the role of delegate of the
/// UIApplication main object.
///
/// As an additional responsibility, it creates instances of GtpEngine and
/// GtpClient and sets them up to communicate with each other.
///
/// @note Since this project does not use any .xib files, the party responsible
/// for creating an instance of ApplicationDelegate is the project's main()
/// function (actually the main() function informs another global function,
/// UIApplicationMain(), of which type instantiate). The single instance of
/// ApplicationDelegate then becomes available to clients via the class method
/// sharedDelegate().
