/// @brief The GoNode class represents a node in a tree of nodes. The tree model
/// corresponds directly to the one in SgfcKit (and therefore SGF).
///
/// @ingroup go
///
/// The public interface of GoNode has methods that allow to navigate the game
/// tree, but it does not allow to modify the game tree. This functionality is
/// provided by the separate GoNodeAdditions category that enhances the GoNode
/// interface.
///
/// The linking between nodes in the game tree is effected by the three
/// primitive properties @e firstChild, @e nextSibling and @e parent. These
/// three primitive properties are cheap to use and do not incur any calculation
/// overhead. All other properties (e.g. @e previousSibling, @e lastChild,
/// @e children) and methods (e.g. isDescendantOfNode:(), isAncestorOfNode:())
/// are in some way or other based on the three primitive properties and require
/// a certain amount of processing time for calculation.
