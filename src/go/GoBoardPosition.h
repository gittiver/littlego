/// @brief The GoBoardPosition class defines which position of the Go board is
/// currently described by the GoPoint and GoBoardRegion objects attached to a
/// given GoGame.
///
/// A board position is how the Go board looks like after the information in a
/// game tree node has been applied to the board. This can be a move made by a
/// player, a series of stones set or cleared by board setup, markup being
/// drawn on one or more intersections, etc. Although in some cases the Go
/// board does not look differently after a node's information has been applied
/// (e.g. a pass move that does not play a stone, a node that only contains a
/// comment, etc.), the board before and after such a node is considered to be
/// in a different position.
///
/// In the course of a game, a new board position is created by each node
/// created by user interaction (e.g. a move made by a player). GoBoardPosition
/// provides a simple way how to refer to a board position: The reference is
/// made with a numeric value:
/// - Board position 0 refers to game tree root node, the beginning of the game
///   when no board setup has been made yet and no moves have been played yet.
///   If the game uses handicap, the handicap stones have already been placed in
///   this position.
/// - Board positions 1, 2, etc. refer to the position after the information in
///   node 1, 2, etc. have been applied to the board.
///
///
/// @par Synchronization of current board position and object states
///
/// At any given time, the combined state of all the GoPoint and GoBoardRegion
/// objects attached to a GoGame instance describes how the Go board looks like
/// at that time.
///
/// Upon initialization, GoBoardPosition is associated with a GoGame instance.
/// The value of GoBoardPosition's @e currentBoardPosition property is in sync
/// at all times with the current state of the GoPoint and GoBoardRegion objects
/// attached to the GoGame instance.
///
///
/// @par Effects of synchronization
///
/// Changing the board position via the @e currentBoardPosition property
/// automatically updates the state of all associated GoPoint and GoBoardRegion
/// objects. Changing the board position in this way typically, but not
/// necessarily, occurs in response to user interaction (e.g. the user taps a
/// toolbar button to view the next/previous board position).
///
/// If the state of GoPoint and GoBoardRegion objects associated with a
/// GoBoardPosition instance changes, the value of the @e currentBoardPosition
/// property automatically changes to reflect the new state. Currently the only
/// event that triggers this is if a new move is made via one of the
/// move-generating methods in GoGame/ (GoGame::play:() and GoGame::pass()).
///
/// TODO xxx Update the documentation in the previous paragraph to include
/// game setup.
///
///
/// @par Notifications
///
/// Use KVO to observe @e currentBoardPosition and @e numberOfBoardPositions for
/// changes. In case both properties change their value in response to the same
/// event, the notification for @e numberOfBoardPositions is sent before the
/// notification for @e currentBoardPosition.
///
/// Because changing the current board position can be a lengthy operation,
/// the client that triggers the change may wish to display a progress meter to
/// indicate to the user that the operation is still running. The client in this
/// case can observe the default notification center for the notification
/// #boardPositionChangeProgress. The notification is sent (B-A) times for a
/// board position change from A to B. Note that KVO observers of
/// @e currentBoardPosition will still be notified just once.
