/// @brief The GoNodeSetup class collects game setup information made in the
/// game tree node that the GoNodeSetup is associated with. Game setup consists
/// of placing black and/or white stones on the board, removing existing stones
/// from the board (including handicap stones), and setting up a side (black or
/// white) to play the first move. When GoNodeSetup places or removes stones on
/// the board, a new board position with a new Zobrist hash is created.
///
/// @ingroup go
///
/// Design note: It is expected that only small parts of the board are actually
/// set up with stones. It is therefore most efficient, memory-wise and also for
/// the size of the NSCoding archive, for capturePreviousSetupInformation() to
/// only capture the points that have stones on them. Whoever needs to work with
/// empty points can (and must) infer what these points are, at the cost of
/// additional processing time and power.
