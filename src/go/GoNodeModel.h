///
/// GoNodeModel provides access to the full game tree to its clients via the
/// property @e rootNode.
///
/// GoNodeModel also provides access to one specific branch of the game tree,
/// commonly known as a game variation, or just variation. The currently
/// configured variation is presented to clients as a sequence of nodes that
/// can be accessed via an index-based API, similar to an array. Indexes are
/// zero-based. The node located at index position 0 is always the game tree's
/// root node. The node located at the highest index position is accessible via
/// the @e leafNode property.
///
/// Invoking GoNodeModel methods that add or discard nodes generally sets the
/// GoGameDocument dirty flag.
