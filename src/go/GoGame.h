/// @brief The GoGame class represents a game of Go.
///
/// @ingroup go
///
/// GoGame can be viewed as taking the role of a model in an MVC pattern that
/// includes the views and controllers in #UIAreaPlay. Clients that run one of
/// the various commands (e.g. #PlayMoveCommand) will trigger updates in GoGame
/// that can be observed by registering with the default NSNotificationCenter.
/// See Constants.h for a list of notifications that can be observed.
///
/// Although it is possible to create multiple instances of GoGame, there is
/// usually no point in doing so, except for unit testing purposes. During the
/// normal course of the applications's lifetime the following situations can
/// therefore be observed:
/// - No GoGame object exists: This is the case only for a brief period while
///   the application starts up.
/// - One GoGame object exists: This situtation exists during most of the
///   application's lifetime. This GoGame instance represents the game that is
///   currently in progress or that has just ended. The instance can be accessed
///   by invoking the class method sharedGame().
/// - Two GoGame objects exist: This situation occurs only for a brief moment
///   while a new game is being started. One of the GoGame objects is the game
///   that is going to be discarded, but is still available via sharedGame().
///   The other GoGame objects is the new game that is still in the process of
///   being configured. Access to this new GoGame object is not available yet.
///   The new GoGame object becomes officially available via sharedGame() when
///   the notification #goGameDidCreate is being sent.
