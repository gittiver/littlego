/// @brief The GoPoint class represents the intersection of a horizontal and a
/// vertical line on the Go board. The location of the intersection is
/// identified by a GoVertex, which is used to create the GoPoint object.
///
/// @ingroup go
///
/// A GoPoint has a "stone state", denoting whether a stone has been placed on
/// the intersection, and which color the stone has. Instead of accessing the
/// technical stoneState() property, one might prefer to query a GoPoint object
/// for the same information using the more intuitive hasStone() and
/// blackStone() methods.
///
/// The liberties() method behaves differently depending on whether GoPoint is
/// occupied by a stone: If it is occupied by a stone, the method returns the
/// number of liberties of the entire stone group. If the GoPoint is not
/// occupied, the method returns the number of liberties of just that one
/// intersection.
///
/// isLegalMove() is a convenient way to check whether placing a stone on the
/// GoPoint would be legal. This includes checking for suicide moves and Ko
/// situations.
