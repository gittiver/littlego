@class GoPoint;


// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @brief The GoBoardRegion class is a collection of neighbouring GoPoint
/// objects.
///
/// @ingroup go
///
/// GoPoint objects within a GoBoardRegion either all have a stone placed on
/// them (in which case the GoBoardRegion represents a stone group), or they all
/// have no stone (in which case the GoBoardRegion represents an empty area).
/// If the GoBoardRegion represents a stone group, all stones are of the same
/// color.
///
/// Every GoPoint object is always part of a GoBoardRegion. At the beginning of
/// a game there is a single GoBoardRegion that represents the entire board; it
/// contains all existing GoPoint objects. As the game progresses, the initial
/// GoBoardRegion is fragmented into smaller GoBoardRegion objects.
///
/// GoBoardRegion is retained by its GoPoint objects (see the GoPoint::region
/// property). A GoBoardRegion is therefore released when it is no longer
/// referenced by any GoPoint objects.
///
///
/// @par Scoring mode
///
/// GoBoardRegion assumes that if scoring mode is enabled (via setting of the
/// correspondingly named property) the state of the Go board remains static,
/// i.e. no stones are placed or removed. Operating under this assumption,
/// GoBoardRegion starts to aggressively cache information that is otherwise
/// computed dynamically. The benefit is improved performance during scoring.
///
/// Clients do not need to know or care about which pieces of information are
/// cached, this is an implementation detail.
