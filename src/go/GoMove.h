/// @brief The GoMove class represents a move made by one of the players.
///
/// @ingroup go
///
/// A GoMove object always has a type(); the different types of moves are
/// enumerated by #GoMoveType. A GoMove object is always associated with the
/// player who made the move. The player object can be queried for the color of
/// the move.
///
/// If a GoMove object is of type #GoMoveTypePlay it also has an associated
/// GoPoint object which registers where the stone was placed. The GoPoint
/// object is assigned (soon) after construction.
///
/// GoMove objects are interlinked with their predecessor (previous()) and
/// successor (next()) GoMove object. This represents the fact that a game
/// can be seen as a series of moves.
///
///
/// @par Playing/undoing a move
///
/// For a GoMove object that is of type #GoMoveTypePlay, invoking the doIt()
/// method triggers the mechanism for placing a stone. This is a comparatively
/// expensive operation, as doIt() manipulates the entire board to reflect the
/// position that exists after the stone has been placed.
///
/// For a GoMove object that is of type #GoMoveTypePass, invoking the doIt()
/// method has no effect.
///
/// Invoking undo() reverts whatever operations were performed by doIt(). For
/// GoMove objects of type #GoMoveTypePass this resolves to nothing. For GoMove
/// objects of type #GoMoveTypePlay, the board is reverted to the state it had
/// before the move's stone was placed.
///
/// @note doIt() and undo() must never be invoked twice in a row. They can be
/// invoked in alternation any number of times.
