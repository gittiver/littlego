// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @brief Schedules execution of the block @a callback on the main thread
/// after the specified @a delayInSeconds has elapsed, then control immediately
/// returns to the caller before @a callback is actually executed. Does nothing
/// if @a callback is @e nil.
///
/// Block execution is asynchronous even if @a delayInSeconds is 0 (zero) and
/// this method is invoked on the main thread itself.
///
/// @note This method performs the same service as the Foundation framework
/// methods performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:() and
/// performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:(), but for blocks. Because the
/// implementation uses Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) there are subtle
/// differences in timing between executing a block with this method and
/// executing a selector with one of the above-mentioned Foundation framework
/// methods.
///
/// For details on GCD see
/// https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch?language=objc
