/// @brief The NodeTreeViewIntegration class is responsible for handling the
/// integration of the node tree view into the view hierarchy of #UIAreaPlay.
/// NodeTreeViewIntegration performs similar functions as a view controller, but
/// is not derived from UIViewController.
///
/// The view hierarchy of #UIAreaPlay is laid out differently depending on
/// the UI type as well as the user interface orientation that is effective at
/// runtime. However, the integration of the node tree view always works the
/// same, so different controllers can delegate the integration work to
/// NodeTreeViewIntegration.
///
/// NodeTreeViewIntegration assumes that it should integrate the node tree view
/// by adding it as a resizable pane to a ResizableStackViewController that
/// otherwise shows only one resizable pane. The owner of
/// NodeTreeViewIntegration must specify the ResizableStackViewController object
/// during initialization.
///
/// NodeTreeViewIntegration also manages the size distribution of resizable
/// panes in the ResizableStackViewController that was specified during
/// initialization. When it integrates the node tree view,
/// NodeTreeViewIntegration reads the size distribution from the UiSettingsModel
/// object that was specified during initialization and applies that size
/// distribution to the ResizableStackViewController. While the node tree view
/// is integrated, NodeTreeViewIntegration reacts to interactive changes of the
/// size distribution and updates the size distribution value in
/// UiSettingsModel.
///
/// NodeTreeViewIntegration decides whether or not to integrate the node tree
/// view based on the user preference "display node tree view".
/// NodeTreeViewIntegration reads the user preference value from the
/// NodeTreeViewModel object that was specified during initialization. The owner
/// of NodeTreeViewIntegration must trigger the initial integration at the
/// appropriate time (e.g. in the UIViewController method loadView()) by
/// invoking performIntegration(). Later on NodeTreeViewIntegration reacts on
/// its own to changes of the user preference via KVO observing.
