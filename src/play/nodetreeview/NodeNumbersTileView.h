/// @brief The NodeNumbersTileView class is a custom view that is responsible
/// for drawing only a small part (called a "tile") of the visible part of
/// the strip with node numbers.
///
/// Most of what is said in the documentation of the NodeTreeTileView class also
/// applies to the NodeNumbersTileView class. The difference is that
/// NodeNumbersTileView has only one layer and therefore does not need to
/// dynamically add/remove layers. Instead, an outside force is responsible for
/// adding/removing NodeNumbersTileView instances depending on whether node
/// numbers should be displayed, or not.
///
///
/// @par Implementation note
///
/// Node numbers must be drawn independently from the remaining node tree
/// elements so that the user can always see the numbers even if the node tree
/// is zoomed in and scrolled to a position where the node tree's main edge is
/// no longer visible.
///
/// The way to achieve this is to display node numbers in an additional scroll
/// view that scrolls independently from the main scroll view that displays the
/// tree of nodes.
///
/// It would have been possible to add NodeTreeTileView instances to those
/// additional scroll views, and to let NodeTreeTileView manage an additional
/// node number layer that is only active when NodeTreeTileView is in
/// "node numbers" mode. However, this would have bloated NodeTreeTileView
/// and made the class even more complicated than it already is.
