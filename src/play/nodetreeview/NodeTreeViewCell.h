/// @brief The NodeTreeViewCell class represents a cell on the abstract canvas
/// used by NodeTreeViewModel. NodeTreeViewCell contains data that describes the
/// content that should be drawn when the cell is rendered on screen. A
/// NodeTreeViewCell and its position on the canvas is uniquely identified by a
/// NodeTreeViewCellPosition value.
///
/// NodeTreeViewCell can be either a standalone cell, or it can form, together
/// with other NodeTreeViewCell objects, a multipart cell that extends in
/// x-direction across the canvas. All NodeTreeViewCell objects that form a
/// multipart cell have the same values for their content properties (@e symbol,
/// @e selected, @e lines, @e linesSelectedGameVariation), but the value of the
/// property @e part indicates which section of the content should be drawn for
/// that particular NodeTreeViewCell object. Example:
/// - A multipart cell consists of two cells and should render the symbol for
///   a black move.
/// - There are two NodeTreeViewCell objects that make up the multipart cell.
/// - The property @e symbol of all NodeTreeViewCell objects has the value
///   #NodeTreeViewCellSymbolBlackMove.
/// - The property @e part of the first/second NodeTreeViewCell object has the
///   value 1/2.
/// - The rendering process thus knows that it should draw the left/right half
///   of the symbol for the first/second NodeTreeViewCell.
