/// @brief The BoardViewMetrics class is a model class that provides locations
/// and sizes (i.e. "metrics") of Go board elements that can be used to draw
/// those elements.
///
/// All metrics refer to an imaginary canvas that contains the entire Go board.
/// The size of the canvas is determined by two things:
/// - A base size that is equal to the bounds size of the scroll view that
///   displays the part of the Go board that is currently visible
/// - The base size is multiplied by a scale factor that is equal to the zoom
///   scale that is currently in effect.
///
/// Effectively, the canvas is equal to the content of the scroll view that
/// displays the Go board. If the scroll view frame size changes (e.g. when an
/// interface orientation change occurs), someone must invoke
/// updateWithBaseSize:(). If the zoom scale changes, someone must invoke
/// updateWithRelativeZoomScale:().
///
/// Additional properties that influence the metrics calculated by
/// BoardViewMetrics are:
/// - The size of the Go board (e.g. 7x7, 19x19). If the board size changes
///   (e.g. when a new game is started), someone must invoke
///   updateWithBoardSize:().
/// - Whether or not coordinate labels should be displayed. If this changes
///   (typically because the user preference changed), someone must invoke
///   updateWithDisplayCoordinates:().
///
/// If any of these 4 updaters is invoked, BoardViewMetrics re-calculates all
/// of its properties. Clients are expected to use KVO to notice any changes in
/// self.canvasSize, self.boardSize or self.displayCoordinates, and to respond
/// to such changes by initiating the re-drawing of the appropriate parts of the
/// Go board.
///
///
/// @par Calculations
///
/// The following schematic illustrates the composition of the canvas for a
/// (theoretical) 4x4 board. Note that the canvas has rectangular dimensions,
/// while the actual board is square and centered within the canvas rectangle.

/// The coordinates of topLeftBoardCorner, topLeftPoint and bottomRightPoint
/// are based on a coordinate system whose origin is in the top-left corner.
/// UIKit and Core Animation use such a coordinate system, while Core Graphics
/// uses a coordinate system with the origin in the lower-left corner. Also see
/// https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/GraphicsDrawingOverview/GraphicsDrawingOverview.html
///
/// As a small reminder for how to calculate distances, lengths and sizes in the
/// graphics system: The coordinate system is zero-based, and the distance
/// between two points always includes the starting point, but not the end point
/// (cf. pointDistance in the schematic above).
///
///
/// @par Anti-aliasing
///
/// Most calculations are made with integer types. If necessary, the actual
/// drawing then uses a half-pixel translation to prevent anti-aliasing for
/// straight lines. Half-pixel translation is usually needed when lines have an
/// odd-numbered width (e.g. 1, 3, ...). See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2488115/how-to-set-up-a-user-quartz2d-coordinate-system-with-scaling-that-avoids-fuzzy-dr
/// for details. Half-pixel translation may also be necessary if something is
/// drawn with its center at an intersection on the Go board, and the
/// intersection coordinate has fractional x.5 values.
///
/// A straight line of width 1 can be drawn in different ways. Core Graphics
/// can be observed to behave differently for the following cases:
/// - The line is created with a path. To prevent anti-aliasing, the path must
///   start and end at coordinates that have fractional x.5 values.
/// - The line is created by filling a path that is a rectangle of width or
///   height 1. To prevent anti-aliasing, the rectangle origin must be at a
///   coordinate that has integral x.0 values.
///
/// @note It's not possible to turn off anti-aliasing, instead of doing
/// half-pixel translation. The reason is that 1) round shapes (e.g. star
/// points, stones) do need anti-aliasing; and 2) if only some parts of the view
/// are drawn with anti-aliasing, and others are not, things become mis-aligned
/// (e.g. stones are not exactly centered on line intersections).
