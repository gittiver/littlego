/// @brief The BoardViewController class manages the scroll views that display
/// the Go board and the board's coordinate labels.
///
/// BoardViewController has the following responsibilities:
/// - Manage zooming and scrolling of the main scroll view that displays the Go
///   board
/// - Synchronize zooming and scrolling properties of scroll views that contain
///   coordinate label views with the corresponding properties of the main
///   scroll view
/// - Resize scroll views when a view layout change occurs outside of zooming
///   (typically when the device changes orientation). See the documentation of
///   viewDidLayoutSubviews() for details.
///
/// BoardViewController creates additional controllers for managing all gestures
/// except zooming and scrolling. Since these sub-controllers are not view
/// controllers, BoardViewController is also not a container view controller
/// (i.e. it does not use addChildViewController:() to manage these
/// sub-controllers).
