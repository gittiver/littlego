/// @brief The BoardViewLayerDelegateBase class is the base class for all layer
/// delegates that manage one of the layers that make up the board view.
///
/// BoardViewLayerDelegateBase conveniently defines a property that stores a
/// reference to a metrics object that will probably be used by all concrete
/// delegate subclasses. BoardViewLayerDelegateBase also disables implicit
/// animations that normally occur when a delegate draws into a CALayer.
///
/// In addition, BoardViewLayerDelegateBase provides the following simple
/// implementation of the BoardViewLayerDelegate protocol:
/// - Synthesizes the properties @e layer and @e tile (because properties
///   declared in protocols are not auto-synthesized)
/// - In its initializer, creates a new CALayer object and configures that
///   object to use the BoardViewLayerDelegateBase as its delegate. Because
///   of this BoardViewLayerDelegateBase declares itself to adopt the protocol
///   CALayerDelegate, but effectively does not implement any of the methods
///   in that protocol (which is legal since they are all optional). It's the
///   job of the concrete delegate subclass to implement any such methods.
/// - Provides an empty "do-nothing" implementation of notify:eventInfo:().
///   A concrete delegate subclass must override notify:eventInfo:(), otherwise
///   an instance of the concrete delegate class won't react to any events.
/// - Provides an implementation of drawLayer() that invokes the layer's
///   setNeedsDisplay() method if the flag stored in property @e dirty is true.
///   A concrete delegate subclass that does not want to implement its own
///   drawLayer() may therefore simply set the flag to true during
///   notify:eventInfo:() if it wants the layer to be redrawn during the next
///   drawing cycle.
