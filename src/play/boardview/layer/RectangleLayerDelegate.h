/// @brief The RectangleLayerDelegate class is responsible for drawing on points
/// that form a consecutive, unbroken area on the board, i.e. a rectangle (a
/// square is just a special form of rectangle). RectangleLayerDelegate can
/// draw only one rectangle at a time.
///
/// The main use of RectangleLayerDelegate is to draw a temporary overlay at the
/// top of the stack of layers that make up the board view. The rectangular area
/// drawn by RectangleLayerDelegate can change in form and size. The benefit of
/// the overlay mechanism is that other layers do not have to redraw their stuff
/// when this happens.
