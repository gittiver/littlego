/// @brief Updates Auto Layout constraints that manage the size and placement of
/// @a boardView within its superview. The constraints are added to
/// @a constraintHolder (which may or may not be the superview itself).
///
/// @a constraints is expected to hold the current set of constraints that
/// resulted from a previous invocation of this method. The current set of
/// constraints is first removed from @a constraintHolder. @a constraints is
/// then emptied and a new set of constraints is calculated and added to
/// @a constraints. The new set is then added to @a constraintHolder.
///
/// The generated constraints satisfy the following layout requirements:
/// - The board view is square. This is important so that coordinate labels
///   are laid out directly next to the board's edge lines. The following
///   facts are important to understand this:
///   - The coordinate labels are laid out at the edges of the board view.
///   - The board drawing routines always draw the board square and centered on
///     the canvas with a size that matches the smaller dimension of the canvas.
///     The canvas size is defined by the board view's visible bounds.
///   So if the board view was rectangular there would be a gap between one set
///   of coordinate labels and one edge line of the board.
/// - The board view size matches either the width or the height of the
///   superview, depending on which is the superview's smaller dimension. The
///   specified layout axis @a axis, not the current view size at the time this
///   method is invoked, decides which is the smaller dimension. The reason for
///   this approach is that during interface orientation changes the superview's
///   current size may not be accurate. Note that it is also not possible to
///   use the current interface orientation as an indicator for which dimension
///   should be used, because sometimes other views take away space from the
///   board view on current interface orientation's longer axis. In short, the
///   caller has to know which axis to use.
/// - The board view is horizontally or vertically centered within its
///   superview, the axis depending on which is the superview's larger
///   dimension. The logic that determines the larger dimension is the inverse
///   of the logic that determines the smaller dimension.
