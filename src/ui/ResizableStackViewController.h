/// @brief The ResizableStackViewController class is a container view controller

/// ResizableStackViewController by default displays a drag handle between each
/// of the views of its child view controllers. A drag handle reacts to a
/// gesture with which the user grabs the handle and moves it along the axis in
/// which ResizableStackViewController arranges its views. Moving the handle
/// only resizes the two views that are adjacent to the handle, the size of
/// other views does not change.
///
/// ResizableStackViewController supports setting a minimum size for each of its
/// arranged views.
///
/// @note If ResizableStackViewController is configured with
/// #DragHandleStyleNone, no drag handles are shown and resizing works by simply
/// dragging any view that is laid out by ResizableStackViewController. This is
/// a legacy feature that may be removed in the future.

/// Resizing can be disabled by setting the property @e resizingEnabled to
/// @e false. ResizableStackViewController in that case removes all sizing
/// Auto Layout constraints and no longer allows interactive resizing. Drag
/// handles are no longer displayed. The values of the properties @e sizes
/// and @e minimumSizes are ignored.
///
/// ResizableStackViewController also does not allow interactive resizing while
/// there is only a single child view controller, however in that case it
/// assigns the single child view controller's view a size of 100%.

@property(nonatomic, assign) UILayoutConstraintAxis axis;

/// @brief The sizes assigned to the views of the child view controllers. Array
/// elements are NSNumber objects that hold a double value. Each double value
/// expresses a view's relative size as a percentage of the container view. For
/// instance, a relative size of 50% is expressed as the double value 0.5.
///
/// The number of sizes stored in this property is equal to the number of view
/// controllers (property @e viewControllers). Index positions in both lists
/// refer to the same view.
///
/// When this property is set ResizableStackViewController updates the size
/// constraints of the views of its child view controllers according to the new
/// values. Obviously, the sum of all values should equal 100%, but
/// ResizableStackViewController does not take corrective action to ensure this.
/// ResizableStackViewController @b does take corrective action in the following
/// cases:
/// - A size that is less than zero is corrected to be zero.
/// - A size that is less than the corresponding minimum size is corrected to be
///   equal to the corresponding minimum size. Because the other sizes are not
///   adjusted, as a result the sum of sizes may may become greater than 100%.
/// - If the new number of sizes exceeds the number of view controllers, surplus
///   sizes are discarded from the end of the list. As a result the sum of the
///   remaining sizes may be less than 100%.
/// - If the new number of sizes is less than the number of view controllers,
///   missing sizes are created to match the two numbers. The new sizes are set
///   so that they fill up any leftover space to 100%. Leftover space is
///   distributed equally among the newly created sizes. Example: If there are
///   3 view controllers, setting this property with only one 50% size will
///   cause two new 25% sizes to be created. The distribution algorithm honors
///   minimum sizes while also following the goal to not exceed 100%. Example:
///   There are 4 view controllers, and minimum sizes of 20%, 30% and 2x 10%
///   are set for them. Setting this property with only one 40% size will cause
///   three new sizes to be created. The attempt to equally distribute the
///   remaining size of 60% and assign 20% to each of the three sizes will fail
///   because of the second minimum size of 30%. The algorithm will therefore
///   set the second size to 30%, and the third and fourth size will get 15%
///   each (equal distribution of the remaining 30%). Note that the end result
///   may exceed 100% because the algorithm never adjusts sizes that are set
///   explicitly. Example: If there are 3 view controllers with minimum sizes
///   30% each, setting this property with only one 60% size will cause two new
///   30% sizes to be created, resulting in a total of 120%.
