/// @brief The WebBrowserViewController class is responsible for displaying a
/// web view (a WKWebView object) together with a few web browser controls, thus
/// providing a minimal web browser user interface.
///
/// WebBrowserViewController displays the web browser controls in its navigation
/// item. If the controls should be visible WebBrowserViewController therefore
/// needs to be displayed in the stack of a UINavigationController.
///
/// If this is not possible, then whoever integrates WebBrowserViewController
/// into the UI is responsible for making the controls visible. For that
/// purpose, WebBrowserViewController exposes the controls as UIBarButtonItem
/// properties.
///
/// WebBrowserViewController provides the following web browser controls:
/// - A "go back" button.
/// - A "go forward" button.
/// - A "home" button. This button navigates to the "home" URL that was
///   specified when WebBrowserViewController was initialized.
///
/// WebBrowserViewController is initialized with a "home" URL, pointing to the
/// entry point that WebBrowserViewController should initially navigate to.
///
/// If the "home" URL is a file URL WebBrowserViewController allows the web
/// view to access all resources located in the parent folder that contains the
/// filesystem item referenced by the "home" URL. Examples:
///
/// - The "home" URL refers to /foo/bar/baz.html: The web view is allowed to
///   access everything under /foo/bar.
/// - The "home" URL refers to /foo/bar: The web view is allowed to access
///   everything under /foo.
///
/// If an attempt is made to navigate to a file URL that refers to a folder,
/// then WebBrowserViewController redirects the request to instead navigate to
/// the "index.html" file located in that folder. The purpose is to simulate
/// the behaviour of web servers during serverless browsing of file resources.
