/// @brief The ItemPickerController class is responsible for displaying a
/// "Pick Item" view that lets the user pick an item from a list of items.
/// ItemPickerController is intended as an alternative to UIPickerView if
/// UIPickerView's style seems too "heavy-weight".
///
/// The "Pick Item" view is a generic UITableView of grouped style whose cells
/// are created dynamically by ItemPickerController according to the list of
/// items with which it is initialized.
///
/// ItemPickerController can be run in one of two modes:
/// - Modal mode: In this mode, ItemPickerController expects to be presented
///   modally by a navigation controller. ItemPickerController populates its
///   own navigation item with controls that are then expected to be displayed
///   in the navigation bar of the parent navigation controller.
/// - Non-modal mode: In this mode, ItemPickerController expects to be presented
///   in some non-modal way (e.g. pushed on top of a navigation stack, or
///   displayed in a popover). ItemPickerController does not create any
///   additional buttons, it is the caller's responsibility to setup an
///   appropriate way to dismiss ItemPickerController (e.g. create a back button
///   to be displayed in the navigation bar, or let the delegate dismiss
///   ItemPickerController when the user selects an item).
///
/// The controls created in modal mode are:
/// - A "cancel" button used to end the selection process and notify the
///   delegate that no item has been picked.
/// - A "done" button used to end the selection process and notify the delegate
///   that an item has been picked.
///
/// ItemPickerController expects to be configured with a delegate that can be
/// notified when the user has finished picking an item. For this to work, the
/// delegate must implement the protocol ItemPickerDelegate.
