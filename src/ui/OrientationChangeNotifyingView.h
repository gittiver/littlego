/// @brief The OrientationChangeNotifyingView class is a UIView subclass with
/// the only purpose to notify a delegate when the view's dimensions change so
/// that its orientation changes from Portrait to Landscape, or vice versa.
///
/// OrientationChangeNotifyingView is useful because it can be difficult for
/// a view controller to detect which orientation its subviews have without
/// both assigning exact sizes to everything (something one usually wants to
/// avoid when coding for many devices) @b and taking the actual device screen
/// size into account. For instance, overriding the UIViewController method
/// viewDidLayoutSubviews() has proven to be unreliable for this purpose,
/// because the controller's main view may have stopped layouting subviews
/// although the layouting process is still ongoing in deeper layers of the
/// view hierarchy.
