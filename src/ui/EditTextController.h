/// @brief The EditTextController class is responsible for displaying an
/// "Edit Text" view that allows the user to edit a text string.
///
/// The "Edit Text" view consists of the following input elements:
/// - Either a UITextField or a UITextView that allows the user to enter a text
///   (initializing the EditTextController instance with an
///   #EditTextControllerStyle specifies which input element should be used)
/// - A "cancel" button used to end editing without changes. This button is
///   placed in the navigation item of EditTextController.
/// - A "done" button used to end editing, using the currently entered text as
///   the result. This button is placed in the navigation item of
///   EditTextController.
///
/// EditTextController expects to be displayed modally by a navigation
/// controller. For this reason it populates its own navigation item with
/// controls that are then expected to be displayed in the navigation bar of
/// the parent navigation controller.
///
/// EditTextController expects to be configured with a delegate that can be
/// informed when the user has finished editing the text. For this to work, the
/// delegate must implement the protocol EditTextDelegate. The delegate is also
/// notified when the user intends to end the editing session by tapping the
/// "done" button. The delegate can refuse the entered text and prevent the
/// editing session from ending (it should also display an alert to provide
/// feedback to the user why tapping the "done" button has no effect). An
/// optional delegate method allows to validate the text string whenever the
/// user performs edits, and in case of error to display a validation error
/// message.
