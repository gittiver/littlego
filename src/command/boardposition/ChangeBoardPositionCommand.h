/// @brief The ChangeBoardPositionCommand class is responsible for changing the
/// current board position to a new value within the current game variation.
/// Use ChangeNodeSelectionCommand to change the current board position @b and
/// also the current game variation.
///
/// ChangeBoardPositionCommand is executed synchronously if the new board
/// position is not more than a given maximum number of positions away from
/// the current board position. The limit is returned by
/// synchronousExecutionThreshold().  ChangeBoardPositionCommand is executed
/// asynchronously (unless the executor is another asynchronous command) if the
/// new board position is more than this limit away from the current board
/// position. To achieve this effect, the various initializers will sometimes
/// return an object that is an instance of a private subclass of
/// ChangeBoardPositionCommand.
///
/// @note initSynchronousExecutionWithBoardPosition:() can be used to enforce
/// synchronous execution.
///
/// initWithBoardPosition:() and initSynchronousExecutionWithBoardPosition:()
/// must be invoked with a valid board position, otherwise command execution
/// will fail.
///
/// initWithOffset:() is more permissive and can be invoked with an offset that
/// would result in an invalid board position (i.e. a position before the first,
/// or after the last position of the game). Such an offset is adjusted so that
/// the result is a valid board position (i.e. either the first or the last
/// board position of the game).
///
/// After it has changed the board position, ChangeBoardPositionCommand performs
/// the following additional operations:
/// - Posts #currentBoardPositionDidChange to the default notification center
/// - Synchronizes the GTP engine with the new board position
/// - Recalculates the score for the new board position if scoring mode is
///   currently enabled
/// - Marks the application state as having changed, so that the board position
///   can be restored when the application launches the next time. Whoever
///   executes ChangeBoardPositionCommand is responsible for actually saving the
///   application state to disk.
