/// @brief The DiscardAndPlayCommand class is responsible for first discarding
/// all board positions in the future of the board position currently displayed
/// by the Go board, then playing a move.
///
/// No board positions are discarded if the Go board already displays the last
/// board position.
///
/// After board positions are discarded, DiscardAndPlayCommand executes one of
/// several possible play commands. Which one is chosen depends on the
/// initializer that was used to construct the DiscardAndPlayCommand object.
/// The following options exist:
/// - initWithPoint:() results in a #GoMoveTypePlay move made by a human player
/// - initPass:() results in a #GoMoveTypePass move made by a human player
/// - initComputerPlay() results in a move made by the computer either for
///   itself, or on behalf of the human player whose turn it currently is
/// - initContinue() results in a paused computer vs. computer game being
///   continued
///
/// If it discards board positions, DiscardAndPlayCommand posts
/// #numberOfBoardPositionsChanged to the default notification center. Playing
/// a move then causes a second #numberOfBoardPositionsChanged to be posted to
/// the default notification center, followed by #currentBoardPositionDidChange.
