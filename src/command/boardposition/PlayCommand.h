/// @brief The PlayCommand class is responsible for playing a move made by the
/// user, or initiating the playing of a move made by the computer.
///
/// PlayCommand executes one of several possible play commands. Which one is
/// chosen depends on the initializer that was used to construct the
/// PlayCommand object. The following options exist:
/// - initWithPoint:() results in a #GoMoveTypePlay move made by a human player
/// - initPass:() results in a #GoMoveTypePass move made by a human player
/// - initComputerPlay() results in a move made by the computer either for
///   itself, or on behalf of the human player whose turn it currently is
/// - initContinue() results in a paused computer vs. computer game being
///   continued
///
/// If the user is currently viewing a board position in the middle of the
/// current game variation, the "new move insert policy" user preference decides
/// how the new move is inserted into the node tree. Notably, if the user
/// preference is set to #GoNewMoveInsertPolicyReplaceFutureBoardPositions,
/// future nodes after the current board position are discarded!
