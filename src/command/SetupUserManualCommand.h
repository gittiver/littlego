/// @brief The SetupUserManualCommand class is responsible for setting up the
/// user manual if it has not been set up yet, or updating the currently set up
/// user manual if it is outdated. Command execution occurs asynchronously.
///
/// The user manual content is obtained from the resource bundle.
///
/// @note Even though command execution occurs asynchronously this command
/// does not disable a progress HUD. The submitter of the command is responsible
/// to handle UI feedback during command execution.
