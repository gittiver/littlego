/// @brief The SaveSgfCommand class is responsible for saving the current
/// game to a specified destination file in the SGF format.
///
/// SaveSgfCommand uses SgfcKit to encode the information in the current
/// GoGame and its associated objects to the SGF format. If a file with the same
/// name already exists, it is overwritten. If an error occurs, SaveSgfCommand
/// makes an error message describing the problem available to the caller which
/// can then be displayed in the UI.
///
/// SaveSgfCommand makes sure that the resulting .sgf file includes all moves
/// of the game, even if the user currently views an old board position.
///
/// SaveSgfCommand takes the following precautions in order not to overwrite
/// an already existing .sgf file needlessly:
/// - It first validates the generated SGF content using SgfcKit's validation
///   mechanism. This is essentially a dry run of a full write cycle, the only
///   exception being that the SGF content is not written to disk but to memory.
/// - If validation is successful the SGF content is then written to a temporary
///   file. Only if that filesystem interaction succeeds is the existing .sgf
///   file overwritten with the temporary file.
///
/// SaveSgfCommand executes synchronously.
///
/// The resulting SGF file is structured as follows:
/// - Contains only one game
/// - Contains only one variation
/// - Root node: Contains root properties, e.g. GM and SZ. May also contain
///   node annotation properties (e.g. C, N, GB) and/or markup properties (e.g.
///   CR, AR, LB) if the user for some reason decided to define these things for
///   board position 0.
/// - Game info node: Contains game info properties, e.g. KM, HA, PB, PW. Also
///   contains the board setup property AB to place handicap stones. Note that
///   LoadGameCommand requires the node that contains the HA property to also
///   have an AB property.
///   Currently the root node is also used as the game info node, as per the
///   SGF standard which states that game info properties are usually stored
///   in the root node.
/// - Setup node: An extra node after the root and game info nodes that contains
///   board setup properties, e.g. AB, AW, PL. Note: Handicap stones are placed
///   with AB in the game info node.
/// - 0-n remaining nodes with move properties (e.g. B, W), node and move
///   annotation properties (e.g. C, N, GB, TE), and/or markup properties (e.g.
///   CR, AR, LB).
