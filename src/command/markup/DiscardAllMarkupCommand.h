/// @brief The DiscardAllMarkupCommand class is responsible for discarding
/// all markup associated with the current board position.
/// DiscardAllMarkupCommand first displays an alert that asks the user for
/// confirmation.
///
/// After it has made the discard, DiscardAllMarkupCommand posts the
/// notifications #allMarkupDidDiscard and #nodeMarkupDataDidChange, performs
/// a backup of the current game and saves the application state.
///
/// @note Because DiscardAllMarkupCommand always shows an alert as its
/// first action, command execution will always succeed and control will always
/// return to the client who submitted the command before the markup is actually
/// discarded.
///
/// It is expected that this command is only executed while the UI area "Play"
/// is in markup editing mode. If any of these conditions is not met an alert
/// is displayed and command execution fails.
