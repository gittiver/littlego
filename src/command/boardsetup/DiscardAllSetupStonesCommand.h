// TODO xxx The command should be named "DiscardAllSetupCommand". The discard includes setupFirstMoveColor.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @brief The DiscardAllSetupStonesCommand class is responsible for discarding
/// all stones that the board is currently set up with.
/// DiscardAllSetupStonesCommand first displays an alert that asks the user for
/// confirmation.
///
/// Before it discards setup stones, DiscardAllSetupStonesCommand also discards
/// any moves that the game currently has. Whoever invoked
/// DiscardAllSetupStonesCommand must have previously made sure that it's OK to
/// discard future moves.
///
/// After it has made the discard, DiscardAllSetupStonesCommand syncs the
/// GTP engine, saves the application state and performs a backup of the
/// current game.
///
/// @note Because DiscardAllSetupStonesCommand always shows an alert as its
/// first action, command execution will always succeed and control will always
/// return to the client who submitted the command before the setup stones are
/// actually discarded.
///
/// It is expected that this command is only executed while the UI area "Play"
/// is in board setup mode and the current board position is 0. If any of these
/// conditions is not met an alert is displayed (but command execution still
/// succeeds, as explained further up).
