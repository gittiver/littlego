/// @brief The HandleBoardSetupInteractionCommand class is responsible for
/// handling a board setup interaction at the intersection identified by the
/// GoPoint object that is passed to the initializer.
///
/// Before it discards setup stones, HandleBoardSetupInteractionCommand also
/// discards any moves that the game currently has. Whoever invoked
/// HandleBoardSetupInteractionCommand must have previously made sure that it's
/// OK to discard future moves.
///
/// After it has processed the board setup interaction,
/// HandleBoardSetupInteractionCommand syncs the GTP engine, saves the
/// application state and performs a backup of the current game.
///
/// @note Because HandleBoardSetupInteractionCommand may show an alert, command
/// execution may succeed and control may return to the client who submitted
/// the command before handling of the tap gesture has actually finished.
///
/// It is expected that this command is only executed while the UI area "Play"
/// is in board setup mode and the current board position is 0. If any of these
/// conditions is not met an alert is displayed and command execution fails.
