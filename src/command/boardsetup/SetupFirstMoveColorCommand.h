/// @brief The SetupFirstMoveColorCommand class is responsible for setting up
/// the game with a side that is to play the first move.
///
/// Before it discards setup stones, SetupFirstMoveColorCommand also discards
/// any nodes that the current game variation has. Whoever invoked
/// SetupFirstMoveColorCommand must have previously made sure that it's OK to
/// discard future nodes.
///
/// After it has processed the board setup interaction,
/// SetupFirstMoveColorCommand syncs the GTP engine, saves the application state
/// and performs a backup of the current game.
///
/// It is expected that this command is only executed while the UI area "Play"
/// is in board setup mode and the current board position is 0. If any of these
/// conditions is not met an alert is displayed and command execution fails.
