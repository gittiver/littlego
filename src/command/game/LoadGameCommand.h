/// @brief The LoadGameCommand class is responsible for starting a new game and
/// loading the game data from an SgfcKit object tree.
///
/// LoadGameCommand is executed asynchronously (unless the executor is another
/// asynchronous command).
///
/// The sequence of operations performed by LoadGameCommand is this:
/// - Start a new game by executing a NewGameCommand instance
/// - Parse the SgfcKit objects to obtain additional information that was stored
///   in the .sgf file (handicap, komi, setup, moves, annotations, markup, etc.)
/// - Setup the game with the additional information, leaving the game and board
///   in a state that reflects the main variation of play found in the SgfcKit
///   object tree
/// - Invoke SyncGTPEngineCommand to synchronize the computer player with the
///   information that was read from the .sgf file
/// - Make a backup
/// - Notify observers that a game has been loaded
/// - Trigger the computer player, if it is his turn to move, by executing a
///   ComputerPlayMoveCommand instance
///
/// @attention If the computer player is triggered, the calling thread must
/// survive long enough for ComputerPlayMoveCommand to complete, otherwise
/// the GTP client will be unable to deliver the GTP response and the
/// application will hang forever.
///
///
/// @par SGF data with illegal content
///
/// LoadGameCommand relies on SgfcKit (and the underlying SGFC) having performed
/// many corrections of erroneous SGF content. In addition LoadGameCommand
/// performs validation for some things that are legal in SGF, but not for
/// the app. The canonical example is the check whether a move that was played
/// is legal according to the rules selected by the user when she initiated the
/// load operation.
///
/// If a validation step fails, the entire load operation fails. A new game is
/// started nonetheless, to bring the app back into a defined state.
///
/// An exception that is raised while the moves in the .sgf file are replayed
/// is caught and handled. The result is the same as if one of the sanitary
/// checks had failed.
