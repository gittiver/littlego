/// @brief The BaseTestCase class implements setUp() and tearDown() to provide
/// subclasses with a useful default test environment. BaseTestCase also
/// provides other useful services, such as observing notifications posted on
/// the default global notification center.
///
/// The default test environment looks like this:
/// - An application delegate object is created. The object is available through
///   the instance variable m_delegate.
/// - The logging subsystem is initialized
/// - The user defaults system is initialized with the main application's
///   registration domain data
/// - In addition, user defaults are set up with a "new game" board size of
///   19x19 and two human players (regardless of what the registration domain
///   data contains)
/// - All of the main application's model objects are created and initialized
///   with user defaults data
/// - A new GoGame object is created by submitting a NewGameCommand instance.
///   The object is available through the instance variable m_game.
///
/// Also note that setUp() guarantees that there are no pending autorelease
/// messages when test execution commences. The reason: setUp() wraps an
/// NSAutoReleasePool around its initialization, then drains the pool after
/// initialization is complete.
///
/// A test case method may invoke setUp() and tearDown() on its own as many
/// times as is needed to start over with a clean environment. A test case
/// method may invoke setUp() only if the property @e testSetupHasBeenDone has
/// value @e false - this is because at the time the test method is invoked,
/// XCTestCase has already invoked setUp(), so the test method must not invoke
/// setUp() again.
