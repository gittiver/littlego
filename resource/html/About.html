      <p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics">Firebase Crashlytics</a>
      is the framework used by %applicationName% to collect crash reports and
      send them to the Firebase Crashlytics servers for analysis of the problem.
      Firebase Crashlytics is a part of Firebase, a platform developed by Google
      for creating mobile and web applications. Please note that %applicationName%
      makes a best effort not to use any other part of the Firebase SDK,
      specifically <strong>NO</strong> Google Analytics. All Firebase
      frameworks/SDKs are closed source, but Crashlytics makes use of numerous
      open source software projects. Navigate to the in-app "Licenses" section
      to view the licenses of the involved projects. This app uses the
      Crashlytics SDK, therefore only licenses in the first section "SDK" apply.
      The documents you are presented with are snapshots taken in 2016 (for
      Crashlytics) and 2019 (for Firebase) of web pages that are now defunct.
      Alas, Google no longer seems to publish OSS license information for
      Firebase and its components, so the license information shown in-app may
      or may not be still up-to-date. This version of %applicationName% uses
      Firebase Crashlytics 10.19.0.</p>
